Common Issues with Port 9000

# "Port 9000 is already in use"

This error occurs when another application is already using port 9000. Solutions:

Find and close the application using port 9000
Use a different port:
SonarQube: Edit sonar.properties to change sonar.web.port=9001
PHP-FPM: Edit php-fpm.conf to change listen = 127.0.0.1:9001
***Tomcat***: Edit server.xml to change the connector port
On Windows, find and kill the process: netstat -ano | findstr :9000 then taskkill /PID [PID] /F
On Linux/Mac: lsof -i :9000 then kill -9 [PID]
"SonarQube fails to start"

Common issues with SonarQube startup:

Check if Elasticsearch is running (required by SonarQube)
Ensure you have sufficient memory (at least 4GB recommended)
Check SonarQube logs in logs/sonar.log
Verify database connection settings in sonar.properties
Make sure the user running SonarQube has proper permissions
"PHP-FPM connection issues"

If your web server can't connect to PHP-FPM:

Verify PHP-FPM is running: systemctl status php-fpm
Check the listen directive in php-fpm.conf
Ensure your web server (Nginx/Apache) is configured correctly to pass requests to PHP-FPM
Check permissions on the PHP-FPM socket if using Unix sockets
Examine PHP-FPM logs for errors
