## üß† Best Practices

‚úÖ **Port Management:**  
- Use environment variables for configurable ports  
- Document all port usage in your README  
- Avoid hard-coding ports in production builds  

üîí **Security Tips:**  
- Keep dev databases local only  
- Use `.env` files and never commit secrets  
- Apply HTTPS locally when testing APIs  

‚ö° **Performance:**  
- Enable caching where possible  
- Use Docker for reproducible setups  
- Monitor system resources with `htop` or `docker stats`

## üì¶ Example Dev Setup

Example Docker Compose setup for a simple Python + PostgreSQL stack:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  web:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    env_file: .env
  db:
    image: postgres
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: devpass

```

```rust
Start Angular on port 4201:
ng serve --port 4201
npm start -- --port 4201
Find what's using port 4201:
lsof -i :4201 (Mac/Linux)
netstat -ano | findstr :4201 (Windows)
Kill process on port 4201:
kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:4201) (Mac/Linux)
for /f "tokens=5" %a in ('netstat -aon ^| findstr :4201') do taskkill /PID %a /F (Windows)
Check Angular version:
ng version
npm list @angular/core

üìã Port 4201 Development Summary

Port 4201 serves as a strategic backup and alternative development port for Angular applications, enabling developers to run multiple Angular applications simultaneously or handle port conflicts efficiently. It's particularly valuable for complex development scenarios involving feature branches, version testing, team collaboration, and micro-frontend architectures.

Understanding how to effectively manage multiple Angular applications across different ports, configure workspaces, and implement advanced development workflows is essential for modern Angular development teams. Port 4201 provides the flexibility needed for sophisticated development scenarios while maintaining the same powerful development features as the primary port 4200.
